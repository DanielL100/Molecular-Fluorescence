# Molecular-Fluorescence

Codes for generating linear and parabolic fits for (dis)confirming of Beer-Lambert law & for fitting for exciton-polariton energies dispersion.

## Description

#### Part A:
This part consists of:

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* The code requires the "Statistics" folder in order to calculate statistical tests $\chi^2_{red}$ & $P_probability$ and to create residual plots.
* The code requires the "Fits" folder in order to make fits.

### Executing program

* In order for the code to run you should download all the files.
* For part A you sholud provide:
  * Excel sheets which contain in the first column $\lambda$ and in the second one the Intensity for different concentrations.
  * Optional - a noise sheet that contains the background noise measured by a spectrometer.
* For part B you should provide:
  * Photos of fluorescence that contains the edges of the container.
* For part C you should provide:
  * Excel sheets which contain in the first column $\lambda$ and in the second one the Intensity for different angles.
